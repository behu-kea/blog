# Exam advice



- Go through your presentation quite detailed before the class!
  - Starting out accidentally showing something that does not work is a tough way to start an exam. For us as teachers it does not really matter but it typically throws students off. Therefore plan the presentation showing the things that work. Or if you choose to something that dont work, as long as you have planned it!
- Make sure that your wifi is working
